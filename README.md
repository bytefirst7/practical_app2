**Problem Statement:**

Understand what factors make a car more or less expensive and provide clear recommendations to a used car dealership.

**Solution:**

Per your request, I analyzed the historical vehicle data you’ve collected and applied several predictive models to identify the key factors that drive vehicle pricing. Based on the insights from this analysis, I’ve outlined clear recommendations regarding which vehicle features and types you may want to prioritize on your lot.

**Key factors that increase vehicle price:**
    1. High-end luxury brands such as Ferrari and Porsche
    2. Diesel fuel type
    3. Vehicles in new or like-new condition
    4. Body styles including convertibles, coupes, and trucks
**Conversely, the following features tend to decrease a vehicle’s price:**
    1. Body styles such as SUVs and wagons
    2. Front-wheel drive (FWD) drivetrain
    3. Non-standard transmissions, including anything other than manual or automatic

These patterns can help inform your purchasing strategy to maximize vehicle value and profitability
